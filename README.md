# HR-Attrition-Analysis-Report
The client, an HR department of a mid-sized organization, wanted to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition and improve workforce retention strategies. Their existing reports were Excel-based, static, and lacked actionable insights.

I developed an interactive Power BI Attrition Analysis Dashboard that consolidated employee data from multiple sources into one visual report. The goal was to analyze attrition across departments, job roles, education levels, salary slabs, and age groups, providing HR leaders with a data-driven overview.

Key challenges included inconsistent data formats, missing demographic information, and unclear attrition definitions. I solved these through Power Query transformations, data validation, and creating a star schema model for accurate KPIs like Attrition Rate, Average Age, and Average Tenure.

Using DAX measures and interactive visuals, the dashboard revealed that employees aged 26–35 and those earning under $5K had the highest attrition. These insights helped HR target retention programs and adjust salary structures.

The project delivered measurable results—turning manual reports into an automated, visually rich, and insight-driven HR analytics tool for smarter decision-making.
